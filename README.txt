Pong Game
Introduction
This is a simple implementation of the classic Pong game using Python and Pygame. The game is designed for two players, where each player controls a paddle to bounce the ball and prevent it from going out of bounds. The players can control their paddles using the keyboard arrow keys (Player 1: W and S keys, Player 2: UP and DOWN arrow keys).

How to Play
Run the Python script using your preferred Python interpreter.
The game window will open, and the players' paddles and the ball will be displayed.
Player 1 controls the left paddle, and Player 2 controls the right paddle.
Use the following controls to move the paddles:
Player 1: W (Up), S (Down)
Player 2: UP Arrow (Up), DOWN Arrow (Down)
The ball will start moving automatically once the game starts.
The objective is to bounce the ball with the paddles to prevent it from hitting the top or bottom screen boundaries.
If the ball goes past one of the paddles and hits the left or right screen boundary, the opposing player gains a point.
The game will reset after each point scored or if the ball hits the left or right screen boundary.
Game Rules
The game runs at 60 frames per second.
The ball's speed increases in both the horizontal and vertical directions as the game progresses.
The players' paddles move up or down by a fixed acceleration when the corresponding keys are pressed.
When the ball collides with a paddle, it bounces off in the opposite horizontal direction.
If the ball hits the top or bottom screen boundary, it bounces off in the opposite vertical direction.
The first player to let the ball pass their paddle loses a point.
The game continues indefinitely, and players can play as long as they want.
Dependencies
To run this code, you need to have Python and Pygame installed on your system. You can install Pygame using pip:

Copy code
pip install pygame
Implementation Details
The game is implemented using Python and Pygame library. It defines a Game class that handles game initialization, input processing, game updates, and rendering. The paddles and the ball are represented as 2D numpy arrays, and their positions are updated at each frame based on the player inputs and ball's velocity.

The collision detection for the ball with the paddles and screen boundaries is implemented using axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) collision detection. Whenever a collision occurs, the ball's velocity is updated accordingly to simulate bouncing behavior.

This implementation is a basic version of Pong and can be used as a starting point to build more complex versions of the game with additional features and improvements. Enjoy playing Pong and have fun!
